/*
Write an application for Lambertâ€™s Vacation Rentals. Use separate ButtonGroups to allow a client to select
one of three locations, the number of bedrooms, and whether meals are included in the rental. Assume that
the locations are parkside for $600 per week, poolside for $750 per week, or lakeside for $825 per week.
Assume that the rentals have one, two, or three bedrooms and that each number of bedrooms greater than one
adds $75 to the base price. Assume that if meals are added, the price is $200 more per rental. Save the file as
JVacationRental.java.
