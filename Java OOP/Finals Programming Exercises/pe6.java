6. Design an application for the Sublime Sandwich Shop. The user makes sandwich order choices from list boxes,
and the application displays the price. The user can choose from three main sandwich ingredients of your
choice (for example, chicken) at three different prices. The user also can choose from three different bread
types (for example, rye). Save the file as JSandwich.java.
