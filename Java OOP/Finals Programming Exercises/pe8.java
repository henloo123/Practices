/*
8. Write an application that allows the user to choose insurance options in JCheckBoxes. Use a ButtonGroup 
to allow the user to select only one of two insurance typesâ€”HMO (health maintenance organization) or PPO 
(preferred provider organization). Use regular (single) JCheckBoxes for dental insurance and vision insurance 
options; the user can select one option, both options, or neither option. As the user selects each option, display 
its name and price in a text field; the HMO costs $200 per month, the PPO costs $600 per month, the dental 
coverage adds $75 per month, and the vision care adds $20 per month. When a user deselects an item, make 
the text field blank. Save the file as JInsurance.java.
